#### Overall Impression
A brief gut reaction: what works, what doesn't, and the single biggest opportunity.

#### What's Working
Highlight 2-3 things done well. Be specific about why they work.

#### Priority Issues
The 3-5 most impactful design problems, ordered by importance.

For each issue, tag with **P0-P3 severity** (see [Issue Severity below](#issue-severity-p0p3) for definitions):
- **[P?] What**: Name the problem clearly
- **Why it matters**: How this hurts users or undermines goals
- **Fix**: What to do about it (be concrete)
- **Suggested command**: Which command could address this (from: $impeccable adapt, $impeccable animate, $impeccable audit, $impeccable bolder, $impeccable clarify, $impeccable colorize, $impeccable critique, $impeccable delight, $impeccable distill, $impeccable document, $impeccable harden, $impeccable layout, $impeccable onboard, $impeccable optimize, $impeccable overdrive, $impeccable polish, $impeccable quieter, $impeccable shape, $impeccable typeset)

#### Persona Red Flags
> *Consult the [Personas reference](#persona-based-design-testing) below.*

Auto-select 2-3 personas most relevant to this interface type (use the selection table in the reference). If `AGENTS.md` contains a `## Design Context` section from `impeccable init`, also generate 1-2 project-specific personas from the audience/brand info.

For each selected persona, walk through the primary user action and list specific red flags found:

**Alex (Power User)**: No keyboard shortcuts detected. Form requires 8 clicks for primary action. Forced modal onboarding. High abandonment risk.

**Jordan (First-Timer)**: Icon-only nav in sidebar. Technical jargon in error messages ("404 Not Found"). No visible help. Will abandon at step 2.

Be specific. Name the exact elements and interactions that fail each persona. Don't write generic persona descriptions; write what broke for them.

#### Minor Observations
Quick notes on smaller issues worth addressing.

#### Questions to Consider
Provocative questions that might unlock better solutions:
- "What if the primary action were more prominent?"
- "Does this need to feel this complex?"
- "What would a confident version of this look like?"

#### Run Notes
Keep this compact. Include status for target slug, ignore list, assessment independence, CLI detector, browser visibility, overlay injection, live server cleanup, and temp-file cleanup. For failed or skipped steps, give the concrete observed reason and the fallback signal used. In the final chat response, also include snapshot write and trend read status after persistence has run.

Codex Run Notes are final-chat only. Do not include this section in the persisted snapshot body, because persistence, trend read, and temp cleanup happen after the snapshot write and would otherwise archive stale status such as "pending after persistence."

**Remember**:
- Be direct. Vague feedback wastes everyone's time.
- Be specific. "The submit button," not "some elements."
- Say what's wrong AND why it matters to users.
- Give concrete suggestions. Cut "consider exploring..." entirely.
- Prioritize ruthlessly. If everything is important, nothing is.
- Don't soften criticism. Developers need honest feedback to ship great design.

### Deliver the Report

Write the full report into the chat response now, before any persistence work. This is the deliverable; everything below it is bookkeeping.

Do this first because the alternative is the most common way this command fails: the report gets composed once, straight into the persistence heredoc, and the run ends with a perfect archive nobody has read. Composing it into a file is not delivering it. If the report exists only in `.impeccable/critique/`, the run produced nothing.

Persistence is not the end of the run. After it, the response continues with the trend line and the close.

### Persist the Snapshot

Once the report above is finalized, write it to `.impeccable/critique/` so the user can refer back, and so `$impeccable polish` can pick up the priority issues without a copy-paste.

Skip this step if the Setup slug was null (vague or root-level target).

1. **Write the body to a temp file** so you can pipe it to the helper. Use the full critique report (heuristic table, design-specificity verdict, priority issues, persona red flags, minor observations, and questions), but stop before the "Ask the User" / "Recommended Actions" sections that come later.

   This is a copy of the report you already delivered above, for later commands to read. It is not delivery. If you find yourself composing the report for the first time inside this heredoc, you have skipped Deliver the Report; go back and send it.

   Codex: exclude Run Notes from the temp body file; Run Notes are final-chat only because persistence, trend read, and temp cleanup happen after the snapshot write.

2. **Pass the structured metadata** through `IMPECCABLE_CRITIQUE_META` (JSON), then run the write command:
   ```bash
   IMPECCABLE_CRITIQUE_META='{"target":"<user phrasing>","total_score":<n>,"max_score":<n>,"na_heuristics":"<comma-separated numbers, or empty>","p0_count":<n>,"p1_count":<n>}' \
     .agents/skills/impeccable/scripts/impeccable critique-storage write "<resolved target>" <body-file>
   ```
   `max_score` is the applicable maximum from the heuristic table (40 when every heuristic applied), so a later run can tell a renormalized total from a full one. For a local file target, the helper also records an exact content fingerprint so polish can distinguish the assessed bytes from later edits without relying on Git state or timestamps. The helper prints the absolute path it wrote. Leave that file on disk. Polish closes it; this run does not.

3. **Delete the temp body file** after the write attempt completes, whether the write succeeded or failed. If deletion fails, mention `temp-file cleanup failed: <reason>` briefly in the final output, but do not block the critique.

4. **Read the trend** for context:
   ```bash
   .agents/skills/impeccable/scripts/impeccable critique-storage trend "<resolved target>" 5
   ```
   This returns a JSON array of the last 5 frontmatter entries (including the one you just wrote).

5. **Append a single line to the user-visible output**, after the report and before the questions:

   > **Trend for `<slug>` (last 5 runs): 24 → 28 → 32 → 29 → 32 (out of 40)**
   > Wrote `.impeccable/critique/<filename>`.

   Read `max_score` on each trend entry. When every entry shares one maximum, state it once as above. When they differ, print each score with its own denominator (`24/32 → 30/40`) and note that the runs scored different heuristic sets, so the line is not a like-for-like comparison. Treat a missing `max_score` on an older entry as 40.

   If this is the first run for the slug, the trend is just one score; say so: "First run for this target, no trend yet."

6. **Close the run.** Go to Ask the User below and emit the questions, or the `Questions skipped: <reason>` line when the count allows it. The run is not complete until you do. Persistence is bookkeeping and cleanup is not an ending; stopping here leaves the user with a report and no way forward, and leaves `$impeccable polish` with no priorities to inherit.

This is fire-and-forget. Do not show the user the helper's JSON output; only the human-readable trend line and the written path. Failures here should not block the rest of the flow; print the error and move on.

### Ask the User

**After presenting findings**, use targeted questions based on what was actually found. Ask with Codex's structured user-input/question tool when available, or directly in chat if it is not, and wait for the answer before continuing. These answers will shape the action plan.

Ask in the same message that carries the report, with the report written out first and the question last. Do not split the two across turns: a turn that ends on the report is a turn that ends, and the questions never arrive. Order within the message is what matters, because prose emitted after a structured question is withheld until the user answers.

Ask questions along these lines (adapt to the specific findings; do not ask generic questions):

1. **Priority direction**: Based on the issues found, ask which category matters most to the user right now. For example: "I found problems with visual hierarchy, color usage, and information overload. Which area should we tackle first?" Offer the top 2-3 issue categories as options.

2. **Design intent**: If the critique found a tonal mismatch, ask whether it was intentional. For example: "The interface feels clinical and corporate. Is that the intended tone, or should it feel warmer/bolder/more playful?" Offer 2-3 tonal directions as options based on what would fix the issues found.

3. **Scope**: Ask how much the user wants to take on. For example: "I found N issues. Want to address everything, or focus on the top 3?" Offer scope options like "Top 3 only", "All issues", "Critical issues only".

4. **Constraints** (optional; only ask if relevant): If the findings touch many areas, ask if anything is off-limits. For example: "Should any sections stay as-is?" This prevents the plan from touching things the user considers done.

**Rules for questions**:
- Every question must reference specific findings from the report. Never ask generic "who is your audience?" questions.
- Keep it to 2-4 questions maximum. Respect the user's time.
- Offer concrete options, not open-ended prompts.
- Skipping is allowed only when the report listed **fewer than 3 Priority Issues**. Count them; do not judge the findings "straightforward" by feel. At 3 or more, the questions are required.

**Final-question gate.** The user-visible response must either include the targeted questions or carry the literal line `Questions skipped: <reason>` naming the count that permitted the skip. Each question must include 2-3 concrete answer options tied to the actual critique findings. Do not end with only open-ended questions, and do not end with neither: stopping after the report, having asked nothing and printed no skip line, is the most common way this command fails.

### Recommended Actions

**After receiving the user's answers**, present a prioritized action summary reflecting the user's priorities and scope from Ask the User.

#### Action Summary

List recommended commands in priority order, based on the user's answers:

1. **`$command-name`**: Brief description of what to fix (specific context from critique findings)
2. **`$command-name`**: Brief description (specific context)
...

**Rules for recommendations**:
- Only recommend commands from: $impeccable adapt, $impeccable animate, $impeccable audit, $impeccable bolder, $impeccable clarify, $impeccable colorize, $impeccable critique, $impeccable delight, $impeccable distill, $impeccable document, $impeccable harden, $impeccable layout, $impeccable onboard, $impeccable optimize, $impeccable overdrive, $impeccable polish, $impeccable quieter, $impeccable shape, $impeccable typeset
- Order by the user's stated priorities first, then by impact
- Each item's description should carry enough context that the command knows what to focus on
- Map each Priority Issue to the appropriate command
- Skip commands that would address zero issues
- If the user chose a limited scope, only include items within that scope
- If the user marked areas as off-limits, exclude commands that would touch those areas
- End with `$impeccable polish` as the final step if any fixes were recommended

After presenting the summary, tell the user:

> You can ask me to run these one at a time, all at once, or in any order you prefer.
>
> Re-run `$impeccable critique` after fixes to see your score improve.
