Designs that only work with perfect data aren't production-ready. Harden the interface against the inputs, errors, languages, and network conditions that real users will throw at it.

## Assess Hardening Needs

Identify weaknesses and edge cases:

1. **Test with extreme inputs**:
   - Very long text (names, descriptions, titles)
   - Very short text (empty, single character)
   - Special characters (emoji, RTL text, accents)
   - Large numbers (millions, billions)
   - Many items (1000+ list items, 50+ options)
   - No data (empty states)

2. **Test error scenarios**:
   - Network failures (offline, slow, timeout)
   - API errors (400, 401, 403, 404, 500)
   - Validation errors
   - Permission errors
   - Rate limiting
   - Concurrent operations

3. **Test internationalization**:
   - Long translations (German is often 30% longer than English)
   - RTL languages (Arabic, Hebrew)
   - Character sets (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, emoji)
   - Date/time formats
   - Number formats (1,000 vs 1.000)
   - Currency symbols

Designs that only work with perfect data aren't production-ready.

## Hardening Dimensions

Systematically improve resilience:

### Error Handling

**Network errors**:
- Show clear error messages
- Provide retry button
- Explain what happened
- Offer offline mode (if applicable)
- Handle timeout scenarios

```jsx
// Error states with recovery
{error && (
  <ErrorMessage>
    <p>Failed to load data. {error.message}</p>
    <button onClick={retry}>Try again</button>
  </ErrorMessage>
)}
```

**Form validation errors**:
- Inline errors near fields
- Clear, specific messages
- Suggest corrections
- Don't block submission unnecessarily
- Preserve user input on error

**API errors**:
- Handle each status code appropriately
  - 400: Show validation errors
  - 401: Redirect to login
  - 403: Show permission error
  - 404: Show not found state
  - 429: Show rate limit message
  - 500: Show generic error, offer support

**Graceful degradation**:
- Core functionality works without JavaScript
- Images have alt text
- Progressive enhancement
- Fallbacks for unsupported features

### Edge Cases & Boundary Conditions

**Empty states**:
- No items in list
- No search results
- No notifications
- No data to display
- Provide clear next action

**Loading states**:
- Initial load
- Pagination load
- Refresh
- Show what's loading ("Loading your projects...")
- Time estimates for long operations

**Large datasets**:
- Pagination or virtual scrolling
- Search/filter capabilities
- Performance optimization
- Don't load all 10,000 items at once

**Concurrent operations**:
- Prevent double-submission (disable button while loading)
- Handle race conditions
- Optimistic updates with rollback
- Conflict resolution

**Interrupted gestures** (custom sliders, drag surfaces, scrollable control strips):
- A second finger or pointer lands mid-drag: the first drag keeps its pointer or ends cleanly, never jumps to the new one
- The browser cancels the gesture to scroll (`pointercancel`), capture is lost (`lostpointercapture`), the pointer is released outside the control, or the window loses focus (`blur`) mid-drag: clear the dragging state and release capture
- After each of these, the next tap or drag works without a reload

**Permission states**:
- No permission to view
- No permission to edit
- Read-only mode
- Clear explanation of why

**Browser compatibility**:
- Polyfills for modern features
- Fallbacks for unsupported CSS
- Feature detection (not browser detection)
- Test in target browsers

## Testing Strategies

**Manual testing**:
- Test with extreme data (very long, very short, empty)
- Test in different languages
- Test offline
- Test slow connection (throttle to 3G)
- Test with screen reader
- Test keyboard-only navigation
- Test on old browsers

**Automated testing**:
- Unit tests for edge cases
- Integration tests for error scenarios
- E2E tests for critical paths
- A behavioral regression for each confirmed gesture fix, when the project's test runner can drive input
- Visual regression tests
- Accessibility tests (axe, WAVE)

**Avoid**:
- Assume perfect input (validate everything)
- Ignore internationalization (design for global)
- Leave error messages generic ("Error occurred")
- Forget offline scenarios
- Trust client-side validation alone
- Use fixed widths for text
- Assume English-length text
- Block entire interface when one component errors

## Verify Hardening

Test thoroughly with edge cases:

- **Long text**: Try names with 100+ characters
- **Emoji**: Use emoji in all text fields
- **RTL**: Test with Arabic or Hebrew
- **CJK**: Test with Chinese/Japanese/Korean
- **Network issues**: Disable internet, throttle connection
- **Large datasets**: Test with 1000+ items
- **Concurrent actions**: Click submit 10 times rapidly
- **Interrupted gestures**: Add a second finger mid-drag, scroll across the control, release outside it, switch windows mid-drag; then drag again
- **Errors**: Force API errors, test all error states
- **Empty**: Remove all data, test empty states

For gestures, say what produced the evidence (emulated viewport, synthesized touch, which engine, physical device) and name what stayed untested.

When edge cases are covered, hand off to `$impeccable polish` for the final pass.
