## Empty State Design

Every empty state needs:

### What Will Be Here
"Your recent projects will appear here"

### Why It Matters
"Projects help you organize your work and collaborate with your team"

### How to Get Started
[Create project] or [Import from template]

### Visual Interest
Illustration or icon (not just text on blank page)

### Contextual Help
"Need help getting started? [Watch 2-min tutorial]"

**Empty state types**:
- **First use**: Never used this feature (emphasize value, provide template)
- **User cleared**: Intentionally deleted everything (light touch, easy to recreate)
- **No results**: Search or filter returned nothing (suggest different query, clear filters)
- **No permissions**: Can't access (explain why, how to get access)
- **Error state**: Failed to load (explain what happened, retry option)

## Implementation Patterns

### Technical approaches:

**Tooltip libraries**: Tippy.js, Popper.js
**Tour libraries**: Intro.js, Shepherd.js, React Joyride
**Modal patterns**: Focus trap, backdrop, ESC to close
**Progress tracking**: LocalStorage for "seen" states
**Analytics**: Track completion, drop-off points

**Storage patterns**:
```javascript
// Track which onboarding steps user has seen
localStorage.setItem('onboarding-completed', 'true');
localStorage.setItem('feature-tooltip-seen-reports', 'true');
```

Show onboarding once: track completion and respect dismissals.

**Avoid**:
- Force users through long onboarding before they can use product
- Patronize users with obvious explanations
- Show same tooltip repeatedly (respect dismissals)
- Block all UI during tour (let users explore)
- Create separate tutorial mode disconnected from real product
- Overwhelm with information upfront (progressive disclosure!)
- Hide "Skip" or make it hard to find
- Forget about returning users (don't show initial onboarding again)

## Verify Onboarding Quality

Test with real users:

- **Time to completion**: Can users complete onboarding quickly?
- **Comprehension**: Do users understand after completing?
- **Action**: Do users take desired next step?
- **Skip rate**: Are too many users skipping? (Maybe it's too long or not valuable)
- **Completion rate**: Are users completing? (If low, simplify)
- **Time to value**: How long until users get first value?

When users hit the aha moment fast and don't drop off, hand off to `$impeccable polish` for the final pass.
