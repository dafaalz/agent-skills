Generate a `DESIGN.md` file at the project root that captures the current visual design system, so AI agents generating new screens stay on-brand.

DESIGN.md follows the [official DESIGN.md format spec](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google-labs-code/design.md/main/docs/spec.md): optional YAML frontmatter carrying machine-readable design tokens, followed by up to eight markdown sections in a fixed order. **Tokens are normative; prose provides context for how to apply them.** Sections may be omitted when not relevant, but those present stay in the specified order. Use the canonical headings below so the file remains portable across DESIGN.md-aware tools.

## The frontmatter: token schema

The YAML frontmatter is the machine-readable layer. It's what Stitch's linter validates and what the live panel renders tiles from. Keep it tight; every entry should correspond to a token the project actually uses.

```yaml
---
name: <project title>
description: <one-line tagline>
colors:
  primary: "#b8422e"
  neutral-bg: "#faf7f2"
  # ...one entry per extracted color; key = descriptive slug
typography:
  display:
    fontFamily: "Cormorant Garamond, Georgia, serif"
    fontSize: "clamp(2.5rem, 7vw, 4.5rem)"
    fontWeight: 300
    lineHeight: 1
    letterSpacing: "normal"
  body:
    # ...
rounded:
  sm: "4px"
  md: "8px"
spacing:
  sm: "8px"
  md: "16px"
components:
  button-primary:
    backgroundColor: "{colors.primary}"
    textColor: "{colors.neutral-bg}"
    rounded: "{rounded.sm}"
    padding: "16px 48px"
  button-primary-hover:
    backgroundColor: "{colors.primary-deep}"
---
```

Rules that matter:

- **Token refs** use `{path.to.token}` (e.g. `{colors.primary}`, `{rounded.md}`). Components may reference primitives; primitives may not reference each other.
- **Colors accept any valid CSS color string.** Hex is the recommended default for portability, but preserve an incumbent `rgb()`, `hsl()`, `oklch()`, wide-gamut, or mixed-color value when it is the project's normative source. Never split the source of truth without explicit reason.
- **Component sub-tokens** are limited to 8 props: `backgroundColor`, `textColor`, `typography`, `rounded`, `padding`, `size`, `height`, `width`. Shadows, motion, focus rings, backdrop-filter: none of those fit. Carry them in the sidecar (Step 4b).
- **Scale keys are open-ended.** Use whatever names the project already uses (`oxblood-deep`, `surface-container-low`). Don't rename to Material defaults.
- **Variants are naming convention, not schema.** `button-primary` / `button-primary-hover` / `button-primary-active` as sibling keys.

## The markdown body: eight sections (canonical order)

1. `## Overview`
2. `## Colors`
3. `## Typography`
4. `## Layout`
5. `## Elevation & Depth`
6. `## Shapes`
7. `## Components`
8. `## Do's and Don'ts`

Omit irrelevant sections rather than filling them with invented rules. Put responsive layout in Layout, depth in Elevation & Depth, radius and form language in Shapes, and per-component behavior in Components. Unknown sections are preserved by the format, but new visual guidance should use the canonical structure whenever it fits.

## When to run

- New-work found a coherent incumbent visual system but no `DESIGN.md`.
- The first implementation of a new world is complete and its provisional decisions need to be carbonized.
- An existing `DESIGN.md` is stale (the design has drifted).
- Before a large redesign, to capture the current state as a reference.

If a `DESIGN.md` already exists, **do not silently overwrite it**. Show the user the existing file first. Ask with Codex's structured user-input/question tool when available, or directly in chat if it is not, and wait for the answer before continuing. The choice is refresh, overwrite, or merge.

## Two paths

- **Scan mode** (default): the project has design tokens, components, or rendered output. Extract, then confirm descriptive language. Use when there's code to analyze.
- **Seed mode**: the project is pre-implementation. Ensure PRODUCT.md exists, then reuse new-work's visual-world workshop and write its directional DESIGN.md seed. Re-run in scan mode once there's code.

Decide by scanning first (Scan mode Step 1). If the scan finds no tokens, no component files, and no rendered site, offer seed mode; don't silently switch. `$impeccable document --seed` requests new-work's world workshop, but it does not authorize replacing coherent code: when an incumbent system exists, offer scan mode or route an explicit identity-replacement request through new-work.

## Scan mode (approach C: auto-extract, then confirm descriptive language)

### Step 1: Find the design assets

Search the codebase in priority order:

1. **CSS custom properties**: grep for `--color-`, `--font-`, `--spacing-`, `--radius-`, `--shadow-`, `--ease-`, `--duration-` declarations in CSS files (usually `src/styles/`, `public/css/`, `app/globals.css`, etc.). Record name, value, and the file it's defined in.
2. **Tailwind config**: if `tailwind.config.{js,ts,mjs}` exists, read the `theme.extend` block for colors, fontFamily, spacing, borderRadius, boxShadow.
3. **CSS-in-JS theme files**: styled-components, emotion, vanilla-extract, stitches; look for `theme.ts`, `tokens.ts`, or equivalent.
4. **Design token files**: `tokens.json`, `design-tokens.json`, Style Dictionary output, W3C token community group format.
5. **Component library**: scan the main button, card, input, navigation, dialog components. Note their variant APIs and default styles.
6. **Global stylesheet**: the root CSS file usually has the base typography and color assignments.
7. **Visible rendered output**: if browser automation tools are available, load the live site and sample computed styles from key elements (body, h1, a, button, .card). This catches values that tokens miss.

### Step 2: Auto-extract what can be auto-extracted

Build a structured draft from the discovered tokens. For each token class:

- **Colors**: Group into Primary / Secondary / Tertiary / Neutral (the Material-derived roles Stitch uses). If the project only has one accent, express it as Primary + Neutral; omit Secondary and Tertiary rather than inventing them.
- **Typography**: Map observed sizes and weights to the Material hierarchy (display / headline / title / body / label). Note font-family stacks and the scale ratio.
- **Elevation**: Catalogue the shadow vocabulary. If the project is flat and uses tonal layering instead, that's a valid answer; state it explicitly.
- **Components**: For each common component (button, card, input, chip, list item, tooltip, nav), extract shape (radius), color assignment, hover/focus treatment, internal padding.
- **Layout + spacing**: Extract grid, container, breakpoint, rhythm, and density behavior into Layout.
- **Shapes**: Extract radius, corner, border, clipping, and recurring form behavior into Shapes.

### Step 2b: Stage the frontmatter

From the auto-extracted tokens, draft the YAML frontmatter now (you'll write it at the top of DESIGN.md in Step 4). This is the machine-readable layer: what the live panel and Stitch's linter consume.

- **Colors**: one entry per extracted color. Key = descriptive slug (`oxblood-deep`, `editorial-magenta`, not `blue-800`). Value = whichever format the project treats as canonical (OKLCH or hex; see the frontmatter rules above). Don't split the source of truth: one format in the frontmatter, don't redefine the same token in prose with a different value.
- **Typography**: one entry per role (`display`, `headline`, `title`, `body`, `label`). Typography is an object; include only the props that are real for the project (`fontFamily`, `fontSize`, `fontWeight`, `lineHeight`, `letterSpacing`, `fontFeature`, `fontVariation`).
- **Rounded / Spacing**: whatever scale steps the project actually uses, keyed by whatever scale name the project uses (`sm` / `md` / `lg`, or `surface-sm`, or numeric steps).
- **Components**: one entry per variant (`button-primary`, `button-primary-hover`, `button-ghost`). Reference primitives via `{colors.X}`, `{rounded.Y}`. If a variant needs a property Stitch's 8-prop set doesn't cover (shadow, focus ring, backdrop-filter), carry the full snippet in the sidecar instead.

Skip anything the project doesn't have. Empty scale keys or fabricated tokens pollute the spec.

### Step 3: Ask the user for qualitative language

The following require creative input that cannot be auto-extracted. Ask them in two structured rounds of no more than three questions each (or the harness's lower limit), waiting between rounds:

- **Creative North Star**: a single named metaphor for the whole system ("The Editorial Sanctuary", "The Golden State Curator", "The Lab Notebook"). Offer 2-3 options that honor PRODUCT.md's brand personality.
- **Overview voice**: mood adjectives, aesthetic philosophy in 2-3 sentences, and any confirmed visual anti-reference.
- **Color character** (for auto-extracted colors): descriptive names ("Deep Muted Teal-Navy", not "blue-800"). Suggest 2-3 options per key color based on hue/saturation.
- **Elevation philosophy**: flat/layered/lifted. If shadows exist, is their role ambient or structural?
- **Component philosophy**: the feel of buttons, cards, inputs in one phrase ("tactile and confident" vs. "refined and restrained").

Carry a line from PRODUCT.md only when it is a durable brand commitment that actually constrains the visual system. Page strategy and surface concepts do not belong here.

### Step 4: Write DESIGN.md

The file opens with the YAML frontmatter staged in Step 2b (schema documented at the top of this reference), then the markdown body using the canonical structure below.

```markdown
---
name: [Project Title]
description: [one-line tagline]
colors:
  # ... staged frontmatter from Step 2b
